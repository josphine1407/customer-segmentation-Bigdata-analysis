#  Customer Segmentation — Big Data Analysis  

A comprehensive **customer segmentation analysis** using Python and clustering techniques—built to provide actionable insights from large-scale customer data.

---

##  Project Overview  

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that walks through the process of customer segmentation using machine learning. The aim is to identify distinct customer groups based on their behavioral attributes and visualize these segments for strategic decision-making.

##  Clone the Repository  

To get started, clone the repo to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/josphine1407/customer-segmentation-Bigdata-analysis.git
cd customer-segmentation-Bigdata-analysis
```

## Analysis Workflow

The notebook guides you through these structured steps:

1. Data Loading & Exploration

Load customer data from .csv files

Perform initial exploration—check for missing values, data types, and summary statistics

2. Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

Handle missing values and duplicates

Create or transform features: e.g., total spend, frequency, customer tenure, average basket size

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize distributions using histograms, bar charts, box plots

Analyze relationships and correlations between features

4. Clustering Analysis

Determine optimal clusters using methods such as the Elbow Method or Silhouette Score

Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means) to segment customers

Profile clusters to understand segment characteristics—like high-value vs. low-frequency groups

5. Visualization & Insights

Visualize segment distributions and key metrics per cluster

Derive meaningful business insights:

Identify high-value segments

Recommend targeted marketing strategies

Highlight customer behaviors for product development

## Potential Enhancements

Integrate dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE) to visualize clusters more clearly

Explore other clustering algorithms (DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering)

Automate cluster identification and profiling for periodic updates

Deploy results interactively using Dash or Streamlit dashboards for stakeholders

Combine with transactional systems for real-time segmentation

## Getting Started

Clone the repository (see above).

Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.

Place your dataset files in the Dataset/ folder.

Open customer_segmentation.ipynb in Jupyter and follow the steps sequentially.
